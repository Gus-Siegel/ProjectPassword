## 4. Non-functional requirements

1. readability,maintainability\
Three sections: back-end, front-end, server. Each is written in the same language. \
Importance: Partitioning each part will create modularity and help identify input/output needed for each section. 
Each section is written in the same language so that functions in each section are compatible. \
Verifiability: No section computes something that another section was assigned, each section is written in one language. 
2. reliability\
Available to users on different devices\
Importance: Users are able to access their account several devices, so that their devices are compatible. \
Verifiability: The system can be used on most device types, and does not limit the account to be used on exactly one device. 
3. functionally suitable\
Backend algorithms correctly identify users by their typing style. \
Importance: Users need to be able to log into their account, and not be able to log into others' accounts. \
Verifiability: A user is verified by the system when using their account, and rejected by the system when using another user's account.
