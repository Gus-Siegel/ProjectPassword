## 1. Positioning

### 1.1 Problem statement

[The issue with having many accounts with unique individual passwords affects all internet users who struggle to memorize each individual set of account/password combination and impacts the users time and the account security]

### 1.2. Product Position Statement

[For internet users who have multitudes of passwords, TypeLock is an account login system that uses metrics such as type speed and accuracy to correctly identify the user without the need of a dedicated password; unlike the current system of memorizing unique passwords and their matching accounts, our product does not rely on exact memorization and correct input of a short password but rather the input of a given phrase/paragraph the user hsa seen before. ]

### 1.3. Value proposition

[TypeLock allows internet users easy log in to their accounts without the need to memorize individual passwords by analyzing their typing metrics to grant them access to their accounts.

Internet users that have difficulty keeping track of their passwords and logging into their individual accounts.]

## 2. Stakeholders

**Users**: Companies looking for the next big login method, people that don't want to remember many different passwords.\
**Competitors**: FaceID and Fingerprint Scan password companies\
**Detractors**: People that don't think reading someone's typing style is secure enough for a password.\
**Developers**: Alexander Siegel, Brock Heinz, Eduardo De La Rosa, Levi Watlington, Michael Vertin, Taylor Nielsen

## 4. Non-functional requirements

1. readability,maintainability\
Three sections: back-end, front-end, server. Each is written in the same language. \
Importance: Partitioning each part will create modularity and help identify input/output needed for each section. 
Each section is written in the same language so that functions in each section are compatible. \
Verifiability: No section computes something that another section was assigned, each section is written in one language. 
2. reliability\
Available to users on different devices\
Importance: Users are able to access their account several devices, so that their devices are compatible. \
Verifiability: The system can be used on most device types, and does not limit the account to be used on exactly one device. 
3. functionally suitable\
Backend algorithms correctly identify users by their typing style. \
Importance: Users need to be able to log into their account, and not be able to log into others' accounts. \
Verifiability: A user is verified by the system when using their account, and rejected by the system when using another user's account.
